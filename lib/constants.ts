		description: "Conducted numerous simulations on Oort cloud and stellar flyby by REBOUND package, revealed and explained the Oort cloud behaviors during single and binary star invasions. Theoretically explained a possible comet shower caused by HD 7977â€™s flyby 3 Myr ago, analyzed comet duration, intensity, and its impact on the ancient Earth. Collected geographic evidence of craters and comet components, revealing that this comet shower could be the cause of the Pliocene-Pleistocene Transition.",
